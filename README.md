# Stood Project

This project was a startup idea my friend and I wanted to implement back in college. The purpose is to match students that have a higher undestand on a specific subject to those who are struggling to grasp the concepts, and in this way promote learning and a little source of income to the students.

This project is using Ruby on Rails on the backend and React JS on the frontend.
